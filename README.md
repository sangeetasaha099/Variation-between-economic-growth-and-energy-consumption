Examining the effect of economic growth on the growth of energy consumption during high economic growth and low economic growth periods

# Introduction
In the past numerous studies have been conducted to study the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. Different studies have been conducted in different time periods to study the relationship. Some researchers have found a causality from economic growth to energy consumption whereas some have found a causality running from energy consumption to economic growth but what exactly do we mean by economic growth and energy consumption. 

Energy consumption refers to all the energy used to perform an action, manufacture something. In factory, energy consumption refers to the total energy consumes in a production process. In household, energy consumption includes the use of electricity, gas, water and other energies. For transportation the energy consumption include how much diesel or gasoline vehicles consume to run. In general energy consumption does not always come from a single energy source. The availability of energy has transformed the course of humanity over the last few centuries. Not only new sources of energy has been discovered, but also in the quantity we can produce and consume. There are different measures of energy consumption, for instance joules, extrajoules, million tonnes of oil equivalent, barrel equivalent, British thermal units, terawatt-hours. 

To get inferences about economic activity within a boundary,Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P) is considered as the most important metric,GDP is the final monetary value of the goods and services produced within a boundary during a specified time period.There are mainly three Methods used to calculate it, namely output, income, and expenditure method.To track economic growth changes in GDP do a reasonable job of capturing changes in economic wellbeing and national income. To track the progress of a nation’s GDP growth rate can be considered a key indicator. GDP growth rate can be thought of as a measure of a nation’s economic ”pulse.The GDP growth rate is the measurement of the percentage change in the value of goods and services produced within a nation’s borders over a specific time period. Generally, countries calculate their annual or quarterly GDP. The GDP growth rate is influenced by a complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors, including innovation, technology,entrepreneurship, and public policy. The GDP growth rate is calculated by comparing the value of a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in a given periodto the value of its GDP in the previous period.GDP used in this calculation is adjusted for inflation to obtain real GDP, which mirrors changes in the volume of goods and services produced instead of changes in their prices. Real GDP is a more accurate measure of economic growth since it takes into account the effects of inflation on the value of goods and services produced andis based on constant 2010 U.S. dollars.

The energy-growth nexus is of great interest to economists as well as policymakers because of its importance in policy implications. Some researchers have argued that economic growth is the key factor that determines the use of energy consumption. 

Stern and Cleveland (2004) in their study of energy and GDP growth observed that GDP growth causes energy consumption when additional variables such as energy prices and other production inputs were included. This limits the prospectus for the further large reduction in energy intensity. 

Cheng (1999) applied the Granger causality method to Indian data (1952-1995) and found that the causality runs from economic growth to energy consumption in both the short run and long run. Similarly, Chan and Lee (1996) used the VECM technique to analyze China’s energy behavior, suggesting that energy prices, income and the share of industry output in national income are significant factors affecting the consumption of energy.

Kraft and Kraft (1978) and Absosedra and Baghestani (1989) also found a causality from GNP to energy consumption. In the cutting edge paper Ghosh (2002) on the study between electricity consumption and economic growth in India period 1951-1997 have found by applying vector autoregression and Granger causality testthat economic growth has an impact on electricity consumption.

Some researchers on the other hand also found a causality running from energy consumption to economic growth. Hwang and Gum (1991) had evident a causality from energy consumption to economic growth for Taiwan. Similarly, Masih and Masih found the same for Taiwan and Korea. Yu and Choi (1985) using data from five different countries confirmed the absence of causality from economic growth to energy consumption.

# Motivation

The study of the relationship between energy consumption and GDP growth rate
has attracted significant attention among researchers, considering energy as a fundamental pillar of modern economic development. Previous studies have extensively
examined this connection, but only a limited number of attempts have been made
to investigate this relationship during periods of high and low GDP growth. This
paper aims to examine the impact of high and low growth regimes on the energy
consumption of selected Asian countries. By conducting this study, we seek to contribute to the existing literature and provide insights into the dynamics of energy
consumption in different growth scenarios.The study of high and low GDP growth
effects on energy consumption can be crucial for informing policy decisions, aiding
economic planning and resource allocation, advancing environmental sustainability
goals, and facilitating comparative analysis for identifying best practices.

# Objective

The objective of the study is to investigate the impact of economic growth on energy
consumption during both high and low growth periods in some ASIAN countries,We
aim to analyze the various factors that influence a country’s economic growth, subsequently affecting energy consumption. High growth is defined as GDP growth
above the mean growth of the data, while low growth refers to GDP growth below
the mean growth.

# Data

Data for the study on the impact of economic growth on energy consumption during
high and low growth periods was collected for the period from 1966 to 2021. GDP
growth data was retrieved from macrotrend, while energy consumption data was
obtained from ourworldindata.org. GDP was calculated as the sum of
gross value added by resident producers, excluding depreciation of assets and resource
depletion. The GDP growth rate was calculated by comparing the GDP of a
specific year to the base year (2010 U.S. dollars). Energy consumption data included
electricity, transport, and heating, calculated using the ”substitution method” accounting for energy waste as heat during combustion. To ensure consistency, energy
data was converted to terawatt-hours. This data provides a comprehensive basis for
analyzing the relationship between economic growth and energy consumption during
different growth phases, contributing to diplomatic and research-oriented discussions
on energy and sustainable development.

Data taken is for 5 developing nations named INDIA, INDONESIA, THAILAND, PHILIPPINES, PAKISTAN and 2 developed Asian nations named JAPAN and SINGAPORE. The selected countries, including developed nations like Japan and Singapore, and developing nations like India, Pakistan, Thailand, Philippines, and Indonesia, offer a diverse representation of economic, social, and geographical factors in the Asian region. This allows for a comprehensive analysis of how GDP growth affects energy consumption patterns across different stages of economic development, providing valuable insights for policy-making and understanding energy dynamics in varied contexts.
